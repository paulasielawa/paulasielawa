- 👋 Hi, I’m Paula Sielawa. 
- 👀 Besides programmering I’m interested in painting but there is something completely irrelevant for you so let's skip this part. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and studying Information Technology in Oslo in Norway. I am in my first year of studies and currently dealing 
- with rest APIs with Spring and Java. 
- 📫 You can reach to me via email sielawapaula@gmail.com
